# CropImageReconition_TL
  This project demonstrates an approach of transfer learning which can achieve crop images recognition. In our case, we employed three types of pre-trained model. They are ResNet50, VGG16 and MobileNet respectively.
  The objective of this project is to find out the most suitable pre-trained model for this scenario, judging from their performance on testing set.
